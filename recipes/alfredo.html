                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick)</li>
                        <li>2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
                        <li>Salt to taste</li>
                        <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Melt Butter and Cook Garlic (Optional):
                            In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. If using garlic, add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant (be careful not to burn it).</li>
                        <li>Add Heavy Cream:
                            Pour the heavy cream into the pan and stir it into the butter. Heat the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it starts to simmer. Do not let it boil.</li>
                        <li>Incorporate Parmesan Cheese:
                            Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese, a little at a time, until it melts and blends smoothly into the sauce.</li>
                        <li>Season the Sauce:
                            Add salt and black pepper to taste. Stir the sauce until it reaches your desired consistency (it should be creamy and slightly thick).</li>
                        <li>Serve Immediately:
                            Toss the Alfredo sauce with cooked pasta (such as fettuccine, linguine, or penne) and mix well to coat evenly. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</li>
                
                <h4>Tips:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>For a richer flavor, you can add a pinch of nutmeg or a splash of white wine while simmering the cream.</li>
                        <li>Use freshly grated Parmesan for the best taste and texture.</li>
                        <li>Serve immediately, as Alfredo sauce thickens as it cools.</li>
                    </ol>
