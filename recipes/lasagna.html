            <ul>
                <li>1 container (15 oz) ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>

                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <ul> 
                <li>12 lasagna noodles (cooked and drained or no-boil noodles)</li>
                <li>Extra mozzarella and Parmesan cheese for topping (optional)</li>
            </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</li>
                    <p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the ground beef until browned, breaking it into small pieces.</p>
                    <p>Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until softened (about 3-5 minutes).</p>
                    <p>Stir in the marinara sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Let simmer for 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
                <li>Make the Cheese Filling:</li>
                    <p>In a medium bowl, mix ricotta cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella, Parmesan, egg, salt, and pepper until well combined.</p>
                <li>Preheat the Oven:</li>
                    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>
                <li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li>
                    <p>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.</p>
                    <p>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</p>
                    <p>Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce.</p>
                    <p>Repeat the layers (noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce) until all ingredients are used, ending with meat sauce on top.</p>
                    <p>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and extra Parmesan cheese on top for a golden crust.</p>
                <li>Bake:</li>
                    <p>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from burning) and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</p>
                <li>Rest and Serve:</li>
                    <p>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set.</p>
            </ol>
